# Rainbow-BASIC
Fixing what Jack refused to


License: MIT

Rainbow BASIC seeks to fix what the commodore PET originally lacked. It adds dedicated graphics and sound commands, joystick routines and SID playback. The commands are simplified and there is a built in grid at 80x25 for easy graphics manipulation. No more Peek or Poke. This BASIC is a mix of Logo, INglish (the parser from the Hobbit) and BASIC code. So if you want to move the joystick you would write:

MOVE THE JOYSTICK TO (grid coordinate)

or to draw a circle:

DRAW CIRCLE AT (grid)

Sound commands (PLAY, SAW etc)

still a WIP

MIT license. don't break the law and don't rule 34 my code, I WILL PROSECUTE!

it's meant to be easy enough for kids but just as good for those that want a real treat AND it hooks into the PET color graphics of winvice 3.9. I plan to add support for the HRE board in the near future (but not anytime soon, 2 days without rest is a killer)
thank you Co-Pilot
