MANUAL for Rainbow basic V0.1

🌈 RAINBOW BASIC — COMMAND REFERENCE (v0.1)
A modern extension language for the Commodore PET / 8296

Rainbow BASIC expands the PET’s classic BASIC with new verbs for graphics, sound, entity memory, and grid‑based movement. Commands are entered at the RAINBOW> prompt.

This manual describes each command, its syntax, and its intended behavior.
(Some commands are stubs in the current build and will evolve in later versions.)

🎨 GRAPHICS COMMANDS
GRAPHICS
Enters Rainbow BASIC’s graphics mode.

Syntax:

Code
GRAPHICS
Description:  
Switches the PET into Rainbow BASIC’s custom graphics environment.
In the current stub, this prints a confirmation message.
In future versions, this will activate:

HRE (High‑Resolution Emulation)

Grid overlays

Drawing primitives

Screen buffers

DRAW CIRCLE LINE
Draws a diagonal “circle line” demonstration.

Syntax:

Code
DRAW CIRCLE LINE
Description:  
A placeholder drawing routine that plots a diagonal line using PETSCII block characters.
Used to verify graphics memory access and screen addressing.

🧭 MOVEMENT COMMANDS
MOVE AT X,Y
Moves an entity or cursor to an absolute grid coordinate.

Syntax:

Code
MOVE AT X,Y
Description:  
Interprets X and Y as absolute positions on the 80×25 grid.
Future versions will map this to entity positioning, cursor control, or sprite‑like objects.

MOVE TO X,Y
Moves toward a target coordinate.

Syntax:

Code
MOVE TO X,Y
Description:  
Represents a “pathing” or “targeting” move.
In future builds, this will support:

stepwise movement

collision checks

AI navigation

tweening

🎵 SOUND COMMANDS
PLAY SAW WAVE ENVELOPE
Plays a rising sawtooth‑style tone sweep.

Syntax:

Code
PLAY SAW WAVE ENVELOPE
Description:  
Demonstrates envelope‑style sound generation.
In the stub, this uses PET’s SOUND command to sweep frequencies.
In future versions, this will route to:

SID emulation

ADSR envelopes

Waveform selection

Multi‑voice playback

SID
Controls SID‑style sound parameters.

Syntax:

Code
SID <parameters>
Examples:

Code
SID WAVE SAW
SID FREQ 440
SID VOICE 2
Description:  
A general‑purpose SID control verb.
Currently a stub that echoes the command.
Future versions will write directly to SID registers or a SID‑compatible driver.

🗺️ GRID COMMANDS
GRID
Displays the 80×25 grid index map.

Syntax:

Code
GRID
Description:  
Prints a coarse grid map where each cell is represented by a number.
Useful for:

coordinate debugging

MOVE AT / MOVE TO testing

entity placement

screen layout planning

🧩 ENTITY MEMORY COMMANDS
These commands extend BASIC’s PEEK/POKE into structured “entity memory,”
allowing Rainbow BASIC to behave more like a MUD engine or game runtime.

PEEK_ENT X
Reads a value from entity memory.

Syntax:

Code
PEEK_ENT X
Description:  
Reads a byte from memory address X and prints the result.
Future versions will map this to:

entity tables

AI state

inventory slots

world data

POKE_ENT X,Y
Writes a value to entity memory.

Syntax:

Code
POKE_ENT X,Y
Description:  
Writes value Y to memory address X.
Future versions will enforce entity boundaries and structured memory layouts.

📦 DATA MANAGEMENT COMMANDS
DAT_ENT
Automatically scans and processes all DATA statements in the program.

Syntax:

Code
DAT_ENT
Description:  
Searches the entire BASIC program for lines containing DATA.
Intended for:

auto‑loading entity definitions

map data

scripted events

animation frames

Future versions will parse and store DATA into entity memory automatically.

🏁 SUMMARY
Rainbow BASIC introduces a new command vocabulary for PET development:

Category	Commands
Graphics	GRAPHICS, DRAW CIRCLE LINE
Movement	MOVE AT, MOVE TO
Sound	PLAY SAW WAVE ENVELOPE, SID
Grid	GRID
Entity Memory	PEEK_ENT, POKE_ENT
Data Automation	DAT_ENT
This manual describes the behavior of the current stub interpreter.
As the system evolves, each command will gain deeper functionality,
eventually forming a full PET‑era creative environment.

Have Fun
